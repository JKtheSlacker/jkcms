Way back when, I built a website to do a number of things. As I picked up PHP,
that website grew to doing a number more of things, until it resembled a CMS.
It was ahead of its time, but also not something I thought to throw out there
for others. After learning Ruby on Rails for my senior project, I made a note
to convert my site at some point in the near future. The time has now come,
so here's the (currently under heavy development) codebase of my new Content
Management System. Sure, it may be duplicated work, but I can rest in the
satisfaction of knowing I wrote it anyway.

I can pretty well guarantee this is not ready for deployment yet (in accordance
with the prophecy.)
